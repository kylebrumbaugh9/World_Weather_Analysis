# World_Weather_Analysis

## Summary

The purpose of this project was to enhance the PlanMyTrip app that I built during the modules. The beta tester will be able to create a travel itinerary and create a travel route between the 4 cities of their choosing and it will display a map of their suggested route. 

## Notes

This was an incredibly difficult project.  Most of my issues were with looping through the list of lists of lists that came back from the JSON. I developed a relatively greasy solution to the problem but it gets the job done. Also, the GeoViews documentation is lightyears behind the Google Maps API and was far more difficult to work with. I frequented stackoverflow and Googled a LOT on this project. Where I may not have taken the appropriate route, I think I got the right answer, 10 hours later :)
